# Data-Analysis
#### Overview: 
We recognize that asking for a complete statistical model from beginning to end is unrealistic, so that is not what we expect out of this exercise. Instead, please make sure to respond with a high-level work flow going into detail where you deem necessary.

#### Timeframe: 0 – 90 minutes

#### Instructions: 
Please respond to each of the following open-ended questions. You should save your responses in a separate document, and submit the finished work to the github branch. When asked, please refer to the Sample_Data spreadsheet attached. For context, assume this is a file with raw data from a client and that this file is sent monthly.

- Please review the Sample_Data spreadsheet. Explain some of the steps you would expect to be taken during the ETL process. You can assume any tools are available for use. You can also assume any database technology/architecture.

- Looking at the data, are there any insights you believe you could provide? 
For example, one might look to predict that a particular merchant is the source of fraudulent transactions with some level of confidence. 
Please list a number of these types of insights given the data from the Sample_Data spreadsheet. 

- Please pick any one of the insights you described in question number two. Provide a high-level explanation of each step you would take as a Data Scientist in order to provide a working statistical model for that insight. You should note any decision making, such as 
    - how you would handle reducing Sample Bias, 
    - how you would leverage/add to a feature library etc.

- Are there any obvious holes in the available data that would give the set more value? If so, what other data would be useful, and what insight could be gained if the data were included in the raw file every month?

###### NOTE: 
Don’t get caught up with the exact data in each column. Instead put more weight into the columns themselves and what they represent. You can make assumptions about the correctness of the data.
